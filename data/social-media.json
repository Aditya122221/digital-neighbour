        { "q": "Do you work with creators?", "a": "Yes. We collaborate with your team or external creators to scale content." },
        { "q": "How do you track success?", "a": "We measure hook performance, retention and actions with weekly iteration." },
        { "q": "How often should I post on TikTok?", "a": "TikTok rewards daily posting for algorithm favor. We recommend posting at least once daily, ideally 2-3 times per day when possible. The algorithm forgets content quickly, so consistency maintains momentum and discoverability." },
        { "q": "What makes a TikTok hook effective?", "a": "Effective hooks capture attention within the first 3 seconds with compelling visuals, intriguing questions, or bold statements. We test hook frameworks like pattern interrupts, problem statements, and curiosity gaps to identify what keeps viewers watching." },
        { "q": "How do you balance trends with brand authenticity?", "a": "We identify trends that align with your brand values and audience, adapt trending sounds and formats to your brand voice, and create trend-responsive content that feels authentic rather than forced. Not every trend fits every brand." },
        { "q": "What video length works best on TikTok?", "a": "TikTok now favors longer content (30-60+ seconds) when retention is strong. We test various lengths, starting with shorter videos to build momentum, then expanding to longer-form content that delivers deeper value and improves overall watch time signals." },
        { "q": "Can you help with TikTok advertising integration?", "a": "While we focus on organic TikTok growth, we can coordinate with your paid ads team to ensure organic and paid strategies complement each other. Organic content often tests well for paid campaigns." },
        { "q": "How do you grow followers on TikTok?", "a": "Follower growth comes from consistent daily posting, creating shareable content that earns saves, engaging authentically with comments and other creators' content, using trending sounds strategically, and focusing on retention metrics that signal quality to the algorithm." },
        { "q": "What metrics should I focus on for TikTok?", "a": "Priority metrics include video view rate, average watch time and retention curves, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), follower growth rate, and profile visits. We analyze retention curves to identify where viewers drop off and optimize accordingly." }

        { "q": "What video retention strategies work best?", "a": "Retention starts with strong hooks, maintaining pacing, using visual variety, delivering on thumbnail promises, structuring content with clear value delivery points, and ending with compelling CTAs. We analyze retention curves to identify drop-off points and optimize content structure." },
        { "q": "How often should I upload YouTube videos?", "a": "Upload frequency depends on your content capacity and audience expectations. Consistent weekly uploads typically perform well.

We optimize titles for search and clickability, write descriptions with keywords and CTAs, research tags strategically, create engaging titles that deliver on promises, and structure content to align with viewer search intent." },
        { "q": "How do you grow YouTube subscribers?", "a": "Subscriber growth comes from consistent upload schedules, delivering value that viewers can't find elsewhere, clear calls-to-action in videos, compelling channel branding, engaging with comments, creating playlists that encourage binge-watching, and community posts that maintain engagement between uploads." },
        { "q": "What's included in YouTube community management?", "a": "We respond to comments promptly, moderate spam and inappropriate content, engage with top contributors, use community posts to maintain engagement between videos, manage YouTube Community tab content, and build relationships with active subscribers to foster loyalty." },
        { "q": "How do you measure YouTube success beyond views?", "a": "We track click-through rates (CTR), average view duration (AVD), audience retention curves, subscriber growth rate, engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares), watch time, and revenue metrics when applicable. Retention and watch time often matter more than raw view counts." }

        { "q": "How often should I pin on Pinterest?", "a": "Pinterest favors consistent daily pinning. We recommend pinning 5-15 pins per day for optimal reach, spread throughout the day to maximize visibility. Fresh pins perform better than repinning the same content repeatedly." },
        { "q": "What makes a Pinterest pin successful?", "a": "Successful pins have vertical formatting (2:3 ratio), clear text overlays that are readable at thumbnail size, compelling visuals, keyword-rich descriptions, relevant boards, and clear calls-to-action. We test pin designs and iterate based on save and click rates." },
        { "q": "How do Pinterest boards affect discoverability?", "a": "Board organization directly impacts Pinterest SEO. We create keyword-rich board titles and descriptions, organize content logically by theme or product category, maintain board freshness with regular pins, and ensure boards align with search intent to improve overall account visibility." },
        { "q": "Can Pinterest drive e-commerce traffic?", "a": "Yes. Pinterest is highly effective for e-commerce when optimized correctly. We focus on product pins with rich metadata, optimized board strategies for product categories, seasonal pinning aligned to shopping cycles, and conversion-focused pin descriptions that drive qualified traffic to product pages." },
        { "q": "What's the difference between saves and clicks?", "a": "Saves indicate interest and future intent—users are bookmarking content for later. Clicks show immediate action and traffic generation. Both matter: saves improve Pinterest algorithm ranking, while clicks drive direct website traffic. We optimize for both, prioritizing clicks for traffic goals." },
        { "q": "How do you optimize Pinterest pin descriptions for SEO?", "a": "We write keyword-rich descriptions (500+ characters when possible), use relevant keywords naturally, include brand names and product terms, add clear CTAs, and ensure descriptions accurately describe visuals to improve Pinterest search ranking and discovery." },
        { "q": "Should I create fresh pins or repin existing content?", "a": "Fresh pins typically perform better algorithmically. We create multiple pin variations for the same content, test different designs and descriptions, and focus on original pins rather than repinning. When repinning, we optimize descriptions and ensure content fits board themes." }

Threads can be posted 2-3 times per week. Real-time relevance matters—responding to trends and conversations quickly can boost visibility." },
        { "q": "What makes a successful X thread?", "a": "Effective threads hook readers with the first tweet, provide clear value through numbered tips or narrative, maintain pacing across tweets, use formatting (bold, emojis) strategically, and end with a compelling CTA.

Quality engagement beats follower counts." },

        { "q": "What's the difference between X threads and regular tweets?", "a": "Threads allow deeper storytelling and value delivery, typically performing better for educational content and thought leadership. Regular tweets work for quick insights, links, and engagement. We balance both: threads for authority building, tweets for daily presence and conversation participation." },
        { "q": "How do you measure X success?", "a": "Key metrics include impressions, engagement rate (likes, retweets, replies), profile visits, link clicks, follower growth, and most importantly, meaningful conversations and relationships built.

        { "q": "How do you grow Snapchat subscribers?", "a": "Subscriber growth comes from consistent daily story posting, creating shareable content that gets screenshotted, using Snapchat's native features creatively, cross-promoting on other platforms, collaborating with other Snapchat creators, and delivering exclusive content that rewards subscribers for following." },
        { "q": "Can Snapchat drive business results?", "a": "Yes. Snapchat works well for brands targeting Gen Z and younger Millennials.

        { "q": "How do you measure Snapchat performance?", "a": "Key metrics include story views, completion rate (how many viewers watch the full story), screenshot counts (indicates high engagement), subscriber growth, tap-through rates on CTAs, and demographic insights. We analyze which story frames retain viewers to optimize content structure." },
        { "q": "Should I cross-post Snapchat content to other platforms?", "a": "We adapt Snapchat content for other platforms rather than reposting directly. Snapchat has a distinct aesthetic and culture—content should feel native. We create Snapchat-first content optimized for vertical viewing and engagement, then adapt the narrative for Instagram Stories, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts when appropriate." }

        { "q": "How do you avoid backlash?", "a": "We engage within rules, add value first and escalate sensitively when needed." },
        { "q": "How do you identify the right subreddits for my brand?", "a": "We research subreddits where your target audience actively participates, analyze subreddit rules and moderation styles, understand community culture and posting norms, identify relevant niche communities beyond obvious categories, and vet subreddits for brand participation opportunities before engagement." },
        { "q": "What's the best way to participate on Reddit without being seen as spam?", "a": "Authentic participation means contributing value before promoting, engaging in discussions without mentioning your brand initially, following subreddit rules strictly, being transparent when sharing relevant content, and building genuine relationships with community members. We guide you to participate credibly." },
        { "q": "How do you plan and execute AMAs?", "a": "We identify relevant subreddits open to AMAs, coordinate with moderators for approval, prepare Q&A frameworks for common questions, schedule optimal times for visibility, moderate in real-time during AMAs, and follow up on unanswered questions. AMAs require careful planning and authentic participation." },
        { "q": "Can you track Reddit marketing ROI?", "a": "We track metrics like karma earned, comment quality and engagement, referral traffic from Reddit to your site (via UTM parameters), brand mentions and sentiment, and qualitative community feedback. Reddit ROI often includes brand awareness, thought leadership positioning, and relationship building beyond direct conversions." },
        { "q": "What types of content work on Reddit?", "a": "Reddit favors helpful, educational content that solves problems. We focus on sharing expertise genuinely, answering questions comprehensively, providing value through guides and tips, engaging in niche discussions authentically, and creating content that addresses subreddit members' specific needs." },
        { "q": "How do you handle negative Reddit interactions?", "a": "We respond professionally and transparently, acknowledge legitimate concerns, take conversations offline when appropriate, avoid defensive responses that escalate situations, and know when to disengage from unproductive discussions. Protecting brand reputation while maintaining authenticity is key." },
        { "q": "Should I create my own subreddit?", "a": "Creating a branded subreddit can work for established brands with active communities, but requires sustained moderation and community building. We evaluate whether your audience would naturally gather on Reddit and provide guidance on whether a branded subreddit makes sense versus participating in existing relevant communities." }

        { "q": "Do you handle contracts and briefs?", "a": "Yes. We manage contracts, briefs and approvals to keep campaigns on track." },
        { "q": "How do you track ROI?", "a": "We use unique links, promo codes and platform analytics for attribution." },
        { "q": "How do you find the right influencers for my brand?", "a": "We identify creators whose audience aligns with your target customers, analyze engagement quality (not just follower counts), vet influencers for brand fit and authenticity, check past partnership performance when available, and consider micro-influencers who often deliver higher engagement rates and better ROI." },
        { "q": "What's the difference between macro and micro influencers?", "a": "Macro influencers (100K+ followers) offer broader reach but often lower engagement rates and higher costs. Micro-influencers (10K-100K) typically have higher engagement, more authentic relationships with audiences, and better cost efficiency for niche targeting. We recommend a mix based on campaign goals." },
        { "q": "How much do influencer partnerships cost?", "a": "Costs vary widely by follower count, platform, and deliverables. Rates typically range from a few hundred dollars for micro-influencers to tens of thousands for macro creators. We negotiate fair rates, often package multiple creators for efficiency, and focus on ROI rather than just reach—tracking actual conversions and brand lift." },
        { "q": "What should be included in an influencer brief?", "a": "Effective briefs include campaign objectives and key messaging, content requirements and brand guidelines, required deliverables (posts, stories, videos), usage rights and timeline, disclosure requirements (FTC compliance), performance expectations, and creative freedom allowances. We create clear briefs that set expectations while allowing creator authenticity." },
        { "q": "How do you ensure FTC compliance for influencer partnerships?", "a": "We ensure proper disclosure requirements are met (e.g., #ad, #sponsored), include disclosure language in contracts, review content before posting to verify compliance, and stay current with FTC guidelines. Proper disclosure protects both brands and creators while maintaining transparency with audiences." },
        { "q": "Can you manage long-term influencer relationships?", "a": "Yes. We coordinate ongoing partnerships, negotiate multi-campaign deals for better rates, develop brand ambassador programs for sustained relationships, and track long-term performance to identify creators worth investing in repeatedly. Long-term partnerships often yield better content and stronger results." },
        { "q": "What metrics matter for influencer campaign success?", "a": "We track engagement rates (not just impressions), click-through rates on links, conversion attribution, brand lift metrics, content quality and alignment, audience demographics match, and cost per acquisition. Reach matters less than reaching the right audience with authentic messaging." },
        { "q": "How do you handle influencer content approvals?", "a": "We establish clear approval workflows with reasonable turnaround times, provide constructive feedback that maintains creator authenticity, use approval tools to streamline processes, balance brand requirements with creator creative freedom, and ensure final content meets disclosure and quality standards before publication." }
